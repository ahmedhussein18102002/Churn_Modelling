# Churn Modelling Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, and models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest are implemented for prediction.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd churn_modelling_project
   ```
2. Place the dataset `P1_Churn_Modelling.csv` in the project folder.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Churn_Modelling.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells step by step to see data preprocessing, model training, and results.

## Results
- The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Performance comparison charts are included in the notebook.

## Future Work
- Testing additional ML models.
- Improving feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
